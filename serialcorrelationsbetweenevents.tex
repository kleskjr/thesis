\chapter{Serial correlations between events}

\section{Summary}
  serial correlation between intervals and peak; gabazine and SCH influence
\section{Introduction}
  why are we interested in that 
\section{Methods}
  \subsection{Data}
  %___________________
  datasets from previous chapter plus ...
    \subsubsection{Dataset 4: CA3 extra only}
      CA3 extracellular field potentials only: 20 recordings

      maybe a plot of extra events, raw, filtered, threshold....? or maybe not


    \subsubsection{Dataset 5: MAE}
      MEA dataset from Roberta and Nikolaus

      data was recorded with various arrays. SWRs were already detected by Roberta.
      i took the raw SWR peaks and normalized then, then correlate
      
  \subsection{Data Analysis}
    pass
\section{Results}
  Here I present the main results from the data analysis and speculate about
  possible mechanisms underlying the occurrence of SWRs. explore a few hypothesis and etc.

\section{Discussion}
  bla bla
