\chapter{Modulation of SWR incidence}

\section{Summary}

  Sharp-wave ripples are network events in the hippocampus that involve large
  number of cells that fire in synchrony within a time window of 20-100 ms.
  Despite the huge attention that SWRs are attracting, the exact mechanisms of SW
  generation, termination are still debatable.  An {\it in-vitro} model of SWs was
  developed by Maierxxxx has largely facilited the study of the SWs. In this
  chapter I review the literature on the effects of various drugs on the SW
  incidence and discuss on the possible mechanisms of drug control on SWs.
  Moreover, I analyse 2 datasets of {\it in-vitro} recordings provided by Nikolaus and
  show that the gaabaA antagonist gabazine does not only decrease SW incidence
  but also increases SW amplitudes. GabaB antagonist SCH..., on th eother side
  increases SW incidence but decreases the amplitude of the events. The results
  suggest the existance of a limited resourse that is gettting depleted by SWs
  and recovered by time

  GB: 
    The role of $\rm GABA_B Rs$ in the modulation of SWRs is unclear. Various
    studies have reported that blocking the $\rm GABA_B Rs$ in slices doesn't
    alter the SWR properties, such as incidence, amplitude, duration
    \cite{Hollnagel2014, Hofer2015}
    It has been shown that $\rm GABA_B Rs$ are involved in SW modulation 
    \cite{Maier2102}
    but also Behrens? showed that in their model it did not modulate incidence?

  \subsection{Hypothesis on the CA3 circuitry giving rise to SWs}

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Slow and fast inhibitory populations; disinhibition taking place (Ellender; Schligloff)
      \item Slow Inh is targeting distal branches of dendrites; because we don't see IPSPs in the Vm between events
      \item Slow Inh is PV negative; excitation of PV+ INs leads to SWs
    \end{enumerate}

    In the previous chapter I propose a computational model for the emergence
    of SWs and the associated replay of sequences. However, such model
    consisting of 2 populations (excitatory and inhibitory) is a crude
    approximation of the CA3 hippocampal network, where over 20 different types
    of neurons have been reported \citep{Maccaferri2003, Klausberger2008}. In
    this section I present a phenomenological model of a minimal hypothetical
    CA3 circuit consisting of 3 populations (excitatory and 2 inhibitory) that
    gives rise to the sharp-wave events observed in slices. This hypothesis
    aims to explain some paradoxical results reported in the literature. The
    proposed model relies on number of assumptions that are to be tested in
    experiments. Moreover, it comes with some predictions that can validate or
    invalidate the proposed model.

    A contra intuitive experimental finding is the fact that SWRs can be evoked
    by the driving inhibitory neurons to fire \citep{Ellender2010,
    Schlingloff2014}. In particular, \cite{Schlingloff2014} has demonstrated
    that SWRs can be elicited by a transient optogenetic drive of the $\rm
    PV^+$ interneurons (Figure~\ref{fig:sclingloff6}). The authors show that
    SWRs are evoked a few milliseconds after the onset of the light impulse,
    and the number of ripples is stable irrespectively of the length of the
    light stimulations (Figure~\ref{fig:sclingloff6}E). On the other hand,
    silencing the $\rm PV^+$ lead to suppression of spontaneous SWs. Moreover
    during the evoked SWs, whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from $\rm PV^+$
    interneurons reveal phasic excitation EPSPs.

    silincing pv+ also stops the SW

    A simple two-population model consisting of single excitatory and
    inhibitory populations can not explain the above-mentioned phenomenon where
    activation of interneurons leads to the occurrence of SWRs and increases
    the multiunit activity. To understand the mechanisms behind SWR generation
    one needs to look beyond the 2-population model (as present in Chapter 2)
    and consider additional mechanisms. A few explanation have been proposed as
    possible mechanisms:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Depolarizing effects of $\rm GABA_A$ receptors. It has been shown
        that during the early phases of development and during certain
        conditions in {\it in-vitro} preparation $\rm GABA_A$ receptors can have
        depolarizing effects on the postsynaptic membrane potentials of
        pyramidal cells \citep{Cohen2002, Gulledge2003, Banke2006,
        Szabadics2006}. In such scenario driving the PVBC population would have
        direct excitatory effects on the whole network.
      \item Inhibition leads to rebound excitation. \cite{Cobb95} has shown
        that inhibitory inputs to depolarized pyramidal neurons can lead to a
        brief depolarization following the initial hyperpolarization. During
        the depolarization cells can fire action potentials. Such rebound
        effects taking place simultaneously in multiple neurons would
        effectively lead to their transient synchronization, and thus, to a
        possible population burst.
      \item Inhibition de-inactivates voltage-gated ion channels.
        This idea is in line with \cite{Platkiewicz2011} which have shown that
        the inactivation of $\rm Na$ channels impacts neuron's firing threshold. A
        brief inhibitory/hyperpolarizing input might be sufficient to
        de-inactivate channels that have been inactivated due to continuous
        depolarization. This mechanism can be extended also to other
        voltage-gated ion channels. 
      \item Disinhibition. A possible disinhibitory loop includes basket cells
        which are shown to project to dendritic-targeting interneurons (DTIs)
        \citep{Cobb97, Kohus2016}. According to this hypothesis activation of
        BC leads to strong inhibition of the DTI that actively suppress PC from
        firing between the events. This inhibition of inhibition is direct
        cause of the following SWR.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    The above-mentioned mechanisms are not mutually exclusive as possible
    causes for the inhibitory-driven evoked events. However, some of these
    explanations seem to be more plausible than others. For example, currently
    there is no evidence that $\rm GABA_A$ has depolarizing effects in the
    preparations used as SWR {\it in-vitro} models. Experimental support for membrane
    potential rebounds after inhibitory inputs from PVC is also scarce. The
    fact that silencing the PVC population can interrupt an ongoing SWR event and
    significantly reduce the incidence of spontaneously occurring events
    \citep{Schlingloff2014} supports the last hypothetical mechanisms, the
    disinhibitory circuit.

    According to the disinhibitory hypothesis, the CA3 network is in a balanced state where
    pyramidal neurons and a DTI population are tightly coupled  and in a low
    firing rate regime. The DTIs receive a strong inhibition from the
    $\rm PV^+BC$ that are normally silent in the background state. 
    
    \begin{figure}
      \center

      \caption{
        2popnet
             }
    \label{fig:ca3only_SCsumm}
    \end{figure}

    A different finding..., \cite{Ellender2010} has shown that during
    a continuous ($500\, \rm ms)$ drive of a single perisomatic-targeting
    interneuron, the incidence of SWR occurrence decreases, and then after the
    stimulation is finished, the incidence of SWs increases with a significant
    peak of occurrence 1 to $2\,\rm seconds$ after the stimulation is over
    (Figure xxx). These results do not hold for all the stimulated cells, but for 6/24
    Perisomatic-targeting interneurons are family of different classes of
    interneurons that include cholecystokinin-positive basket cells,
    parvalbumin-positive basket cells, and axo-axonic cells \citep{Freund1996}.
    

    Once PVC are activated \citep{Ellender2010, Schlingloff2014}, the PCs are
    effectively disinhibited resulting in a population burst. It has been
    shown that there is a gradual build-up of PC activity tens of milliseconds
    prior to spontaneous SWR events %\citep{delaPrida, Ellender2010,
    %Schlingloff2014, Hulse2016}. Moreover, excitation of single pyramidal
    cells \citep{Baszelot2016} can also prime the occurrence of SWRs. The
    increased firing of pyramids leads to recruitment of PVBC that consequently
    inhibit the DTIs, and thus, effectively disinhibiting the PC population.
    The conditions in which this disinhibitory circuit works are explored in
    detail in a separate project by Roberta Evangelista. Preliminary results
    give the prediction of strong Py-BC-DTI pathway connections in comparison
    to Py-DTI connections, as well larger connection on the BC-DTI-Py pathway
    in comparison to BC-Py connections.

    To make a complete model of SWR occurrence one should also consider
    mechanisms that control the duration of a SWR and bridge the time interval
    between events to processes on a relevant time scale in the order of
    hundreds of milliseconds to seconds. An important component component of
    such mechanism would be the short-term plasticity of inhibitory
    transmission. It has been shown that basket cells exhibit short-term
    depression of synaptic transmission both on pyramidal cells and on other
    interneurons as well \citep{Kraushaar2000, Kohus2016}. During a SWR event
    BCs fire multiple times with high frequency, and therefore, the efficacies
    of their synapses decrease significantly. Such depression on BC-DTI
    synapses would lead to less inhibition on the DTIs, resulting in their
    recruitment. Once active again, DTIs inhibit the pyramidal population,
    resulting in SWR termination. The recovery of BCs synapses is a relatively
    slow process on the order of hundreds of milliseconds \citep{Kohus2016}
    that might determine the timing between SWR events. Once the synapses
    recover from depression, the BC population is able to disinhibit the CA3
    circuit and lead to the next event. In the Result and Discussion sections, I
    discuss this phenomenological model in the light of the results reported.

    poses, as well as the foreseen shortcomings.

    why stimulating 1 perisomatic neuron suppresses SWs during stimulation, and releases
    SWs immediately after (ellender), while optical stimulation of small populations
    gives birth to SW just 1 ms after the onset of the stimulation (schlingloff) ?????


    recovery of inhib synapses controls the incidence and the SW amplitude

Additional complication might come from the unspecific effects of gabazine:
gabazine blocks glycine receptors \citep{Shirasaki1991} and SK-type potassium 
channels \citep{Pedarzani2001}.

    differential role of gabazine works for 2 pops, but it's unlikely to be the full model
    because 1. the hippocampal zoo of interneurons consists of more than 20 types that are still not 
    fully describeda and understood what are their contributions to SWs.
    2. disinhibitory experiments, 2 pops can not explain that 

information on the order of PC firing can be transfered also through the inhib population.

multiple types of SWs
  - in-vitro experiments show various incedences 0.1 to 10?
  - various ripple frequences
  - reference on diff SWs
  - weather it's always the same circuit is not clear, in studies we have to study a particular 
  in-vitro model and treat carefully results from other in-vitro models. Maybe some benchmarks for 
  classifying the type of SW are observed..

\section{Results}

  In this section I present main results from analysing data...??

  \subsection{Sharp wave amplitude peaks do not determine the interval until next event }
    \label{sec:swr_amp-int}

    The interval between consecutive SWR events \textit{in vitro} varies from
    hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds depending on the experimental
    setup and the slice preparation. Currently, we do not know the underling
    biological processes that have time scales much larger than than the time
    scales of neural activity (typically milliseconds to tens of milliseconds).
    However, a natural assumption is that there is some kind of recovery of the
    system after each event, e.g., depletion of synaptic and neuronal resources
    \citep{Cohen2004, Jones2007}, or short-term depression \citep{Romani2015,
    Kohus2016}, or a slower inhibition evoked by ambient GABA on the
    extrasynaptic $\rm GABA_A$ receptors \citep{Brown1978, Ben1994} or an
    activation of synaptic/extrasynaptic $\rm GABA_B$ receptors
    \citep{Scanziani2000, Hollnagel2014, Lang2014}. Does this recovery time
    depend on the size of a sharp-wave event, e.g., do the larger events
    deplete more resources, and thus, prolong the interval until the following
    event?

    To analyse the dependence between amplitude of peaks and the following
    intervals, I used data provided by Nikolaus Maier. The dataset consists of
    extracellular recordings from the CA3 area of hippocampal slices that
    exhibit spontaneous sharp waves (SWs). I calculated the serial correlation
    between SW peaks amplitudes and the time interval until the following
    event. I found only weak correlations (Figure~\ref{fig:ca3only_SCsumm},
    top-left panel). From the 20 slices, only 9 show correlations that are
    significant ($p<0.001$) with a mean correlation coefficient of around 0.2.
    The results show missing (11/20) or a low dependence between the size of a
    SW and the interval until the following event. Moreover, the correlation
    coefficients are independent of the frequency of spontaneous events in the
    slice (Figure~\ref{fig:ca3only_SCsumm}, bottom-left panel).

      \includegraphics[width= 35pc]{ca3only-cs2.eps}
      \caption{

        of serial correlation coefficients between sharp-wave peaks and the

        correlations ($p<0.001$) that are shown in the boxplot; the blue box

        (bottom-right).
             }
    \label{fig:ca3only_SCsumm}
    \end{figure}

    The majority of recordings show a missing peak-interval correlations. Even
    though depletion might control inter-SW intervals, a low peak-interval
    correlation cannot rule out this mechanism. A possible explanation for this
    observation is that the SW peaks are a local phenomenon, and while being
    large at the recording location, SWs peaks can be smaller at other
    locations of the slice. The next event is then triggered in a site where
    the peak has been rather low and the local resources are less depleted.
    Therefore, we can not predict the time of the next event based on the
    measured amplitude at a particular site because SWs can originate elsewhere
    in the slice. In such cases, the local depletion recovery does not play a
    role in controlling the timing of next events. Following this line of
    reasoning gives us a hypothetical explanation about the surprisingly low
    correlations between peaks and intervals.

    To test the hypothesis relying on the locality of SW amplitudes stated
    above, I analysed data from multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings. The
    dataset was provided by Roberta Evangelista, where multiple sites in the
    CA3 area of hippocampal slices are measured simultaneously. In single
    recordings, the peaks of SW events measured at different locations show
    very high co-variability (an example is shown
    Figure~\ref{fig:peak_correlation_ex}). Moreover, the aggregated data from
    20 different slices show that any two locations in a CA3 slice have
    positive and significant ($p<0.001$) correlations between the measured SW
    peaks (Figure~\ref{fig:peak_correlation_summ}). The high correlations
    between different sites rule out the hypothesis that the SW amplitude is a
    local phenomenon in slices.

             }
    \label{fig:peak_correlation_summ}
    \end{figure}
    
    In summary, the low serial correlation between events shows that the
    amplitude of a SW event does not determine the time interval until next
    event. This absence of peak-interval correlations can not be explained by
    some locality of the SW events as I showed that SW peaks are non-local
    phenomenon, and a large SW measured at one location is likely to be large
    in the whole CA3 region.
    
  \subsection{Sharp wave amplitude and duration is correlated to the time interval since the last event}
    \label{sec:swr_int-amp}
    Another line of reasoning about how depletion might affect the incidence of
    SW events is that the duration of time passed after a SW event would
    influence the recovery of the system. For example, after longer periods of
    time, the network has more time to recover the depleted resources and a
    larger event is to be expected in comparison to shorter inter-event
    periods. To test this idea, I calculated the serial correlation between the
    inter-event time intervals and the peak of the following SW
    (Figure~\ref{fig:ca3only_SCsumm}, top-right panel). Most of the recordings
    show significant ($p<0.001$) and positive correlations (18 out of 20
    recordings). This means that after a long interval the amplitude peak of
    the following SW is big, and after a brief interval, the following sharp
    wave has a smaller amplitude. 

    The high interval-peak correlations found in the data are confirmed by the
    recent results \citep{Kohus2016}. Moreover, \cite{Kohus2016} performed a
    detailed study on the inhibitory connections in the CA3 area and show that
    the outgoing synapses of parvalbumin-positive basket cells (PVBCs) undergo
    short-term depression (STD) that acts on a time scale of hundreds of
    milliseconds. The authors propose that the synaptic recovery from this
    depression is responsible for the peak of SWRs observed in the local field
    potential, and moreover, suggest that this can be a possible mechanism
    controlling the incidence of SWRs.
    
    In the current dataset, the incidence of spontaneous SWs ranges from 0.1 to
    $\sim 1 \,\rm events/sec$ across slices. A natural question is whether the
    incidence influences the serial correlations between the intervals and the
    following SW peaks. Statistical tests (Pearson and Spearman) show that this
    dependence is, however, statistically insignificant. Having a closer look
    at the individual recordings reveals that the dependence between SW
    incidence and the serial correlations is not trivial. While some slices
    show very strong linear dependence between these two parameters (e.g.,
    $c=0.77$, $p<10^{-6}$, in Figure~\ref{fig:linear_inc-corr}), other slices
    show an inverse dependence between the incidence and the serial correlation
    of interval-peak (e.g., $c=0.93$, $p<10^{-6}$, in
    Figure~\ref{fig:inv_linear_inc-corr}). This result suggests that there are
    mechanisms behind the dependence between incidence and serial correlation
    but these mechanism might vary from slice to slice.

      \includegraphics[width= 28pc]{24april13_slice1.png}
      \caption{

        is correlated to the SW amplitude peaks (second panel, units in mV).
        The third panel shows the SW durations (units in ms) in time. The
        correlation between SW intervals and the following peaks are measured
        in 5-minute running time windows and plotted against the incidence
        within that time window. This examples show significant positive
        correlations between incidence and SW peak, and between incidence and
        serial correlation (interval-peak).

        serial correlation (interval-peak).

      \label{fig:inv_linear_inc-corr}

    In summary, the majority of slices (18/20) show positive and significant
    ($p<0.001$) correlations between the time interval since last event and the
    peak amplitude of the following SW. After dividing the recordings in
    5-minute time windows, each slice shows at least once a positive and
    significant serial correlation in some of the time windows. Negative
    correlations are not present.

  \subsection{Gabazine effects on sharp-wave ripples {\textit {in vitro}} }
    \label{sec:gabazine_invitro}
    Hippocampal slices exhibit network dynamics shaped by excitatory and
    inhibitory activities that balance each other \citep{Maier2011}. It is intuitively expected
    that by decreasing the total inhibitory coupling (connections from
    inhibitory to all the other neurons are weakened) the network would get
    into a more excitable state. However, from previous work
    \citep[e.g.,][]{Nimmrich2005} it is known that application of low
    concentration of gabazine (a $\rm GABA_A$ receptor antagonist) decreases
    the rate of spontaneously occurring sharp waves. How does the application
    of gabazine affect the network activity is not clear. An underlying
    assumption in the current analysis is that the decrease of incidence is due
    to a decrease of the firing rate of the excitatory population. But how does
    a decrease of inhibition lead to a more inhibited network? To tackle this
    paradox, in this section I analyse some data provided by Nikolaus Maier in
    which gabazine is applied to hippocampal slices.
    
    Gabazine (SR-95531) is a $\rm GABA_A$ receptor antagonist that binds to the
    GABA-binding site, effectively decreasing the inhibitory conductances. For
    low drug concentrations block phasic but not tonic $\rm GABA_A$ receptors
    \citep{Bai2001, Yeung2003, Behrens2007}. In the experiments analysed here,
    after a few minutes of stable baseline recording, $100 \,\rm nM$ gabazine
    (a low concentration) was applied to the hippocampal slices. A typical
    example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gabazine_ex} where gabazine was applied
    27 minutes after the recording onset (application duration denoted with a
    horizontal red line). Shortly after the drug infusion, the incidence of
    spontaneous events goes down from 0.32 to 0.15 (values are measured in
    5-minute time windows from before and during drug application, independent
    two-sample t-test with p-value $<10^{-6}$). Overlying all detected events
    (before and during drug) relatively to the peak of the filtered signal and
    calculating their mean value shows a stereotypical SW waveform
    (Figure~\ref{fig:gabazine_ex}, bottom panels). There is also slight but
    significant increase of the SW peak amplitudes and duration after the
    gabazine application (??p-values $<10^{-3}$). After the washout (end of red
    bar, at 43 minutes) the incidence of SWs increases back to the values
    before the drug infusion.

    %It is worth noting that in this example recording, there is some
    %high-frequency noise (quantify how high??) in the measured LFP (peaks of the gray traces), likely
    %reflecting the spiking of one or more neurons located nearby the recording
    %electrode. In this example, the network activity seems to be less noisy
    %after the application of gabazine.

    Gabazine decreased the incidence in all 8 slice recordings, in 6 slices the
    decrease was significant (independent two-sample t-test with
    p-value$<0.001$). The average effect is shown in
    Figure~\ref{fig:gabazine_sum} where the incidence is normalized (to value
    of 1) relative to the incidence before drug application. Gabazine starts
    affecting the incidence already 1 minute after application and takes around
    5 minutes to take a full effect.

        dots. The red dots are the averages from all slices.
      }
      \label{fig:gabazine_sum}
    \end{figure}

    To better characterize how the drug affects the network dynamics, further,
    the analysis focuses on the events in constrained time windows only. Events
    from the window [-7, -2] minutes (before drug application) and [6, 11]
    minutes (after drug application) were used to calculate properties of SWs
    (Figure~\ref{fig:gabazine_sum} bottom row). As already mentioned, there is
    a significant effect on the incidence (around 37\% decrease on average).
    However, somewhat weaker effects are observed on the SW peak amplitude and
    duration.  On average, events tend to get bigger after gabazine
    application. 4 out of 8 recordings show significant (p-value$<0.002$)
    increase in SW amplitude peak after the drug application, and 2/8 show a
    decrease in amplitudes. It is not known whether this increase in amplitudes
    is due to direct effects of gabazine or because of the decreased incidence,
    and thus longer recovery time. 

    The found effect on the SW amplitude is in odds with the finding of
    \citep{Schlingloff2014} who showed that a local puff of gabazine \textit{in
    vitro} decreases the SWR amplitude around the application site
    (Figure~\ref{fig:schlingloff_gabazine}). A possible explanation is that the
    incidence in \citep{Schlingloff2014} is intact as SWRs occur at other
    locations of the slice that are unaffected by the drug. The puffed
    location, however, needs more time to recover from previous events and,
    therefore, the frequent events occurring elsewhere can not engage fully the
    affected subnetwork. In the slices used in our analysis, however, the
    gabazine infusion is global, which results in a slight increase of the SWR
    peaks and also a decrease of the incidence.
    
    \begin{figure}
      \includegraphics[width =35pc]{Schlingloff_3bcd5e.png}
      \caption{A local application of gabazine decreases the amplitude of the

        an increased firing and removes the ripple-lock firing of PVBCs. This
        figure is adopted with permission? from \cite{Schlingloff2014}.
      }
    \label{fig:schlingloff_gabazine}
    \end{figure}

    Does gabazine have an effect on the serial correlation between consecutive
    events? To answer this question, the serial correlations (peak-interval and
    interval-peak) were measured before and after drug application in 5-minute
    time windows as described above (Figure~\ref{fig:gabazine_SCsumm}). While
    the peak-interval correlation remains low and does not change after the
    gabazine application, there is a trend of increase in the interval-peak
    correlation. Showing the relation between incidence and interval-peak
    correlation for individual recording (Figure~\ref{fig:gabazine_SCsumm})
    reveals the tendency of decreasing incidence and increased interval-peak
    correlations (6 out of 8 recordings).

    \begin{figure}
      \includegraphics[width= 30pc]{gabazine_SCsumm.eps}
      \caption{

    \label{fig:gabazine_SCsumm}
    \end{figure}

    In summary, gabazine has the contra-intuitive effect of decreasing the
    incidence of SWRs. Moreover, gabazine application has weak effects in
    increasing the SWR amplitudes and the serial correlations between
    inter-sharp-wave interval and the peak of the following SWR. However, due
    to the small dataset (8 recordings), I can not present a conclusive
    evidence of the drug effects.

  \subsection{Gabazine influence on SWR incidence {\textit {in silico} }}
    \label{sec:gabazine_insilico}
    To better understand how gabazine affects the incidence of SWRs
    {\textit {in silico}}, I deploy the assembly-sequence concept (described in
    Chapter~\ref{chap:memoryreplay}) as a model for the spontaneously occurring
    SWs. Here, numerical simulations of balanced networks with embedded assembly
    sequences and a linear firing rate model are used as tools to describe the
    network dynamics under the influence of gabazine.
      
    In the numerical simulations, sequences of neural assemblies consisting of
    both excitatory and inhibitory neurons are embedded into a randomly
    connected network. Recurrent connectivity ($p_{\rm rc}=0.08$) describes the
    connection probability within an assembly while a feedforward connectivity
    ($p_{\rm ff}=0.06$) is the connectivity between the excitatory neurons of
    consequent assemblies in the sequence (sketch of network connectivity is
    shown in Figure~\ref{fig:net_sketch}). With these parameters values, noise
    fluctuations in the firing rates get amplified by the feedforward structure
    resulting in spontaneous replays (Figure~\ref{fig:spontan}). For a more
    detailed description of the numerical model and the parameter values,
    please refer to Chapter~\ref{chap:memoryreplay}. Here, the effects of
    gabazine are modeled simply by decreasing the conductances of the targeted
    inhibitory synapses with a fixed rate (i.e., $5\%$).

    Not surprisingly, gabazine drastically increased the rate of spontaneous
    replays of assembly sequences in the modelled network. This is illustrated
    in Figure~\ref{fig:gabzine_sim}, where gabazine is applied to all inhibitory
    synapses after the $21^{\rm st}$~second of the simulation. The top two
    panel show raster plots of the excitatory and inhibitory neurons where the
    black dots show individual spikes, and the black stripes are burst of
    synchronous activity during which many neurons fire in close temporal
    proximity. The replays during these activity bursts are used as a model of
    the sharp-wave events. The frequency of these population events is
    increased immediately after the simulated gabazine infusion, as seen in the number of
    replays (the top panel), and in the firing rates (third panel). This result
    is in direct opposition with the gabazine effects that are reported
    {\textit{in vitro}} (Section~\ref{gabazine_invitro}).

    \begin{figure}
      \includegraphics[width =35pc]{gabazine_sim.eps}
      \caption{
        Gabazine {\it in silico} increases the rate of spontaneous replays.
        Decreasing all inhibitory conductances (at $21^{\rm th} \rm second$
        with 5\% leads to increase in the incidence of spontaneous replays in
        balanced-network simulations. The two upper panels show rater plots of
        subpopulations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, where each black
        dot denotes a spike. Middle plot shows the firing rate of the
        excitatory and inhibitory populations. The last two panels show the
        currents experienced by one excitatory and one inhibitory neuron. Red,
        blue, gray, and black color denote excitatory, inhibitory, leak, and
        total currents.
            }
    \label{fig:gabazine_sim}
    \end{figure}

    Can a relatively simple two-populations balanced network explain the
    gabazine-associated decrease of SWR incidence reported in experiments?
    $\rm GABA_A$ receptors ($\rm GABA_A R$) are known to be complex channels
    with six subunits that can come in various combinations (for the curious
    readers, see Section~\ref{sec:gabaa_intro}). The expressed subunits largely
    determine the receptor properties, i.e., time constants, affinity to GABA
    and other neurotransmitters. For example tonic $\rm GABA_A R$ are
    insensitive for gabazine at low concentrations while phasic $\rm GABA_A R$
    show various affinities depending on the subunit expression. The subunit
    expression is largely determined by the type of the postsynaptic neuron and
    by the location of the channels on the morphological tree
    \ref{???}. One hypothesis to explain the gabazine-associated decrease of SW
    events relies on the assumption that gabazine has differential effects on
    the different $\rm GABA_A$ synapses. And more specifically, if
    inhibitory-to-inhibitory synapses are affected to a larger degree than the
    inhibitory-to-excitatory synapses, one would expect a network that is less
    disinhibited, and thus, the excitatory population receives more inhibition
    resulting in smaller firing rates. In what follows, I test whether such
    assumptions would really decrease the incidence of modeled events.

    As a toy example in numerical simulation, I consider the extreme case where
    gabazine affects the inhibitory-to-inhibitory synapses only. As expected,
    the firing rate of the excitatory neurons is decreased
    (Figure~\ref{fig:gabazine_sim_giionly}). However, the network shows a
    decrease in the firing rate of the inhibitory population as well. How is it
    possible that excitatory neurons receiving weaker inhibition (smaller input
    rate), fire less? To better understand the effects of gabazine, further, I
    present an analytical approach.
    
    \begin{figure}
      \includegraphics[width =35pc]{gabazine_sim_gii.eps}
      \caption{
        Gabazine {\it in silico} applied only to inhibitory-to-inhibitory synapses

      }
    \label{fig:gabazine_sim_giionly}
    \end{figure}

    To capture the network dynamics, I apply a linear model of a two-population
    balanced network and analyse how the rates depend on gabazine. The network
    dynamics is described by the system of differential equations:
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        \tau \frac{\text{d}r^E}{\text{d}t} &= - r^E + w_{\rm ee} \, r^E -w_{\rm ei} \, r^I + I_0\\
        \tau \frac{\text{d}r^I}{\text{d}t} &= - r^I + w_{\rm ie} \, r^E -w_{\rm ii} \, r^I + I_0\\
      \end{split}
      \label{eq:balanced_net}
    \end{equation}
    where $r^E$ and $r^I$ are excitatory and the inhibitory firing rates,
    respectively. The connection from population $x$ to $y$ is described by the
    connection weight $w_{\rm yx}$ ($x,y = e, i$). The population time constant
    is $\tau$, and the external input to the populations is denoted with $I_0$.

    Assuming that the network is in a steady state, then the rates are
    constant, i.e., $ \frac{\text{d}r^E}{\text{d}t} = 0$ and
    $\frac{\text{d}r^I}{\text{d}t} = 0 $. In this condition, one can express
    the stationary solution:
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        r^E &= \frac{(1+w_{\rm ii} - w_{\rm ei})}{w_{\rm ie}w_{\rm ei} -
                (1+w_{\rm ii})(-1+w_{\rm ee})} I_0 \\
        r^I &= \frac{(1+w_{\rm ie} - w_{\rm ee})}{w_{\rm ie}w_{\rm ei} -
                (1+w_{\rm ii})(-1+w_{\rm ee})} I_0
      \end{split}
      \label{eq:balanced_sol}
    \end{equation}
  
    To estimate how gabazine-induced decrease of inhibitory connections
    affects the firing rates, we can look at the derivatives of the
    steady-state rates in respect to the gabazine concentration $c_{\rm gbz}$:
    \begin{equation}
      \frac{\partial r^E}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} =
      \frac{\partial r^E}{\partial w_{\rm ei}} \cdot \frac{\partial w_{\rm ei}}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} + 
      \frac{\partial r^E}{\partial w_{\rm ii}} \cdot \frac{\partial w_{\rm ii}}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}}
      \label{eq:re_chain}
    \end{equation}
    and
    \begin{equation}
      \frac{\partial r^I}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} =
      \frac{\partial r^I}{\partial w_{\rm ei}} \cdot \frac{\partial w_{\rm ei}}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} + 
      \frac{\partial r^I}{\partial w_{\rm ii}} \cdot \frac{\partial w_{\rm ii}}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}}.
      \label{eq:ri_chain}
    \end{equation}

    The partial derivatives of inhibitory weights ($w_{\rm ei}$ and $w_{\rm
    ii}$) in respect to the drug concentration $c_{\rm gbz}$ is negative due to
    the antagonist  effects of gabazine. The partial derivatives of the rates
    in respect to the inhibitory weights can easily be estimated from
    Equation~\ref{eq:balanced_sol}:
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        \frac{\partial r^E}{\partial w_{\rm ii}} &= 
              I_0 \frac{w_{\rm ei} (1 + w_{\rm ie} - w_{\rm ee})} {D^2} \\
        \frac{\partial r^I}{\partial w_{\rm ii}} &=
              I_0 \frac{(-1 + w_{\rm ee})(1 + w_{\rm ie} - w_{\rm ee})} {D^2} \\
      \end{split}
      \label{eq:drdwii}
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        \frac{\partial r^E}{\partial w_{\rm ei}} &=
              I_0 \frac{-(1 + w_{\rm ii}) (1 + w_{\rm ie} - w_{\rm ee})} {D^2} \\
        \frac{\partial r^I}{\partial w_{\rm ei}} &=
              I_0 \frac{-w_{\rm ie} (1 + w_{\rm ie} - w_{\rm ee})} {D^2} \\
      \end{split}
      \label{eq:drdwei}
    \end{equation}
    where $D=w_{\rm ie}w_{\rm ei} - (1+w_{\rm ii})(-1+w_{\rm ee})$.
    
    If we now assume that gabazine has the same effect on all inhibitory
    synapses, i.e., $\frac{\partial w_{\rm ei}}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} =
    \frac{\partial w_{\rm ii}}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}}$, the change of firing
    rate due to gabazine is:
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        \frac{\partial r^E}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} &=
            \frac{\partial w_{\rm ii}}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} \cdot
            I_0 \frac{-(1 + w_{\rm ii} - w_{\rm ei}) (1 + w_{\rm ie} - w_{\rm ee})} {D^2} =
            - \frac{\partial w_{\rm ii}}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} \cdot \frac{r^E r^I}{I_0} > 0 \\
        \frac{\partial r^I}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} &=
            \frac{\partial w_{\rm ii}}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} \cdot
            I_0 \frac{- (1 + w_{\rm ie} - w_{\rm ee})^2} {D^2} =
            - \frac{\partial w_{\rm ii}}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} \cdot \frac{r^I r^I}{I_0} > 0 \\
      \end{split}
      %\label{eq:x}
    \end{equation}
    In line with the simulations, the derivatives above are always positive (if
    $\frac{\partial w_{\rm ii}}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} < 0 $), i.e., gabazine
    always increases the rate of both excitatory and inhibitory
    populations. 

    Can this linear model model explain the simulation results in which
    gabazine affects only inhibitory-to-inhibitory synapses? There we saw a
    decrease not only in the excitatory but also in the inhibitory firing rates
    (Figure~\ref{fig???,bottom?}). Taking the rate derivatives in respect to
    $w_{\rm ii}$ only (In Equations~\ref{eq:re_chain} and \ref{eq:ri_chain}, we
    assume that $\frac{\partial w_{\rm ei}}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} = 0$):

    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        \frac{\partial r^E}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} &=
            \frac{\partial w_{\rm ii}}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} \cdot
            I_0 \frac{w_{\rm ei}(1 + w_{\rm ie} - w_{\rm ee})} {D^2} =
            \frac{\partial w_{\rm ii}}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} \cdot \frac{w_{\rm ei}}{D} \cdot r^I \\
        \frac{\partial r^I}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} &=
            \frac{\partial w_{\rm ii}}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} \cdot
            I_0 \frac{(-1+w_{\rm ee}) (1 + w_{\rm ie} - w_{\rm ee})} {D^2} =
            \frac{\partial w_{\rm ii}}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} \cdot \frac{-1+w_{\rm ee}}{D} \cdot r^I \,\, . \\
      \end{split}
      %\label{eq:x}
    \end{equation}
 
    Here, the sign of the determinant $D$ from Equation~\ref{eq:balanced_net}
    determines the change in firing rate. Let us first assume that $D<0$. To
    fulfil the requirement for positive firing rates (i.e., $r^I>0$ in
    Equation~\ref{eq:balanced_sol}), then $w_{\rm ee}>1+w_{\rm ie}$ should be
    fulfilled. However, this is unlikely to be the case as the excitatory
    conductances used in the simulations are all equal $g_{\rm ee}=g_{\rm ie}$.
    Therefore, I conclude that $D>0$. In that case, it is easy to see that
    $\frac{\partial r^E}{\partial c_{\rm gbz}} < 0$, meaning that excitatory
    rate decreases when $w_{\rm ii}$ is depressed. This line of arguments is
    supported by the simulations, where gabazine applied to the
    inhibitory-to-inhibitory connections only decreases the excitatory firing
    rate (Figure~\ref{fig:gabazine_sim_giionly}). On the other hand, $r^I$
    shows more interesting behaviour that depends on the excitatory weights.
    For intermediate values $w_{\rm ee} \in (1, 1+w_{\rm ie})$, the inhibitory
    rate decreases during gabazine application as well (as seen in
    Figure~\ref{fig:gabazine_sim_giionly}, top panel). For values of $w_{\rm
    ee}$ outside of this interval, one would expect increase of inhibitory
    firing after the drug infusion. For the prove of concept, I tested a
    network where $g_{\rm ee}=2 g_{\rm ie}$ and show that in such case the
    inhibitory rate goes up after the simulated drug application
    (Figure~\ref{fig:gabazine_sim_giionly}, bottom panel).
    %To test again whether low/high wee increases ri!!!!
    %I tested that by using lower (5 times smaller than default)
    %and higher (5 times larger than default) excitatory-to-excitatory
    %connectivity in the numerical model and found that inhibitory rate is
    %indeed increased (not shown here).

    To summarize the results from this section, by using numerical simulations
    and a linear analytical description, I showed that in a balanced network a
    gabazine application is increasing the firing rates of both inhibitory and
    excitatory populations. This increase of firing leads to higher incidence
    of spontaneous replays which is in odds with the counterintuitive decrease
    of incidence observed {\textit {in vitro}}. Therefore, I tested whether a
    differential effect of gabazine on different synapses can explain the
    experimental results. I considered the extreme case when gabazine affects
    only inhibitory-to-inhibitory synapses and showed that in this case we can
    always expect decrease in the rate of excitatory population. This result
    suggests that possibly stronger effects of gabazine on the inhibitory
    neurons might explain the decreased SWR incidence after gabazine
    application {\textit {in vitro}}.
    
    Here I examine a minimal model consisting of only two populations, but
    nevertheless the approach can provide some means for studying {\it in-vitro}
    models. A similar approach can also be applied to the more accurate
    3-population nonlinear model currently developed by Roberta Evangelista,
    and utilized to examine in what conditions gabazine decreases the network
    excitability. Is it possible that in the 3-population model, a gabazine
    application to all inhibitory synapses can decrease the rate of spontaneous
    events? Or would it be required that the disinhibitory synapses (from PVBC
    to the mysterious inhibitory neurons) are affected to a larger degree?

    A strong assumption in the foundation of the current framework is that the
    decrease of SWR incidence is due to decrease of firing of the excitatory
    population. Whether this is indeed the case has to be confirmed from
    {\it in-vitro} experiments. It is also not known how does gabazine affects the
    firing of the inhibitory populations. The simulations show that gabazine
    applied only on the inhibitory-to-inhibitory connections can decrease not
    only the excitatory but also the inhibitory firing rates. This result is
    interesting by its own as the decrease of $r^E$ is counterintuitive. How
    does it come that the excitatory population decreases its firing rate after
    receiving less inhibition due to the decrease of $r^I$? (should I dive into that??)

  \subsection{Involvement of $\rm GABA_B$ receptors in sharp waves}

    Sharp waves are huge population events where many pyramidal cells and
    interneurons are firing with increased firing rates, which is especially
    pronounced for the perisomatic targeting parvalbumin-positive basket cells
    (PVBCs) and the bistratified cells \citep{Klausberger2009}. It has been
    shown that the repetitive firing of interneurons can activate extrasynaptic
    $\rm GABA_B$ receptors possibly through increased concentrations of ambient
    GABA in the extracellular space \cite{Wang2010,??}. The inhibition from
    $\rm GABA_B Rs$ is relatively slow, lasting several hundreds of
    milliseconds, which is close to the time scale of the typical inter-SW
    intervals. Here, I study the possibility that the relatively long time
    intervals between SW events are determined by $\rm GABA_B Rs$.
    
    First, to investigate whether $\rm GABA_B$ is involved in the SW incidence
    in the {\textit{in-vitro}} model, I analysed extracellular recordings where
    the $\rm GABA_B R$ antagonist SCH50,911 (further referred as SCH) was
    applied in slices. The number of analysed slices is 12 (see the Methods
    section). An example of the SCH effects in a slice are shown in
    Figure~\ref{fig:gB_example}. The drug effects are reflected in the network
    dynamics already during the first minute of application by increasing the
    incidence of SWs (Figure~\ref{fig:gB_example}, top panel). An independent
    two-sample t-test of the incidence (measured as number of events per sweep
    in confined 5-minute time intervals) show a significant increase of
    incidence (p-value $<10^{-7}$). Other main properties, such as, peak
    amplitude and duration are decreased after the SCH application (p-values
    $<10^{-10}$, and $<10^{-3}$, respectively).

        and during SCH application.

    Blocking the $\rm GABA_B Rs$ resulted in increase of the average incidence
    of spontaneous sharp waves from all slices.  The drug effects are visible
    already in the first minute after the application and saturate around 2-3
    minutes later (Figure~\ref{gB_summ}, top panel). To better assess the
    effects of SCH further, the analysis focuses on the events in 5-minutes
    long time windows, i.e., in the intervals [-5, 0] that is before and [2, 7]
    minutes that is during drug application. Comparing the data from these two
    intervals shows that SCH increases the incidence in every recording, and
    10/12 show a significant increase (independent 2-sample t-test;
    p-value$<0.002$). On average, SCH resulted in decrease of SW amplitudes
    (Figure~\ref{gB_summ}, bottom middle panel), where 6/12 slices show
    a significant decrease (p-value$<0.001$), and in 2/12 slices the amplitudes
    were increased (p-value$0.001$). The duration of sharp waves, also
    decreases on average, but however, this change is not significant
    (p-value$>0.01$ in 11/12 slices). While the result for every recording
    varies depending on the exact 5-minute time windows that are used for the
    analysis, the summary results do not change qualitatively.

    \label{gB_summ}
    \end{figure}

    Next, I inquire whether blocking $\rm GABA_B Rs$ affects also the serial
    correlation between events. At first glance the pooled data does not reveal
    any change in the correlations, as the correlation distributions from
    before and during SCH application (Figure~\ref{gB_SCsumm}, top panels) are
    statistically similar. However, looking at the effects in the individual
    recordings (Figure~\ref{gB_SCsumm}, bottom panel) one can see that there is
    a decrease of serial correlation after drug application in 10 out of 12
    slices (the 2 remaining recordings show no significant correlations).

    \begin{figure}
      \includegraphics[width =35pc]{SCH_SCsumm.eps}
      \caption{

        gabazine are calculated in 5-minute long time windows, where $n$ shows
        the number of recordings with significant correlations ($p<0.001$)

        aggregated data from the whole recording (all). \textbf{bottom:} Serial
        correlations coefficients between time interval since last event and
        the following SW peak are plotted against recorded incidence; arrows
        show the change after SCH application.
            }
    \label{gB_SCsumm}
    \end{figure}

    To summarize the findings above, $\rm GABA_B Rs$ are taking part in the SW
    modulation by increasing the incidence and decreasing the peaks of SWs.
    However, the increase in incidence is on average less than two-fold
    suggesting that there are other mechanisms different than $\rm GABA_B$ that
    act on a slow time scales and are involved in controlling the incidence.
    Moreover, blocking $\rm GABA_B Rs$ leads to a decrease in the serial
    correlations between interval and peaks, which is puzzling given the
    increased incidence. Intuitively, one could expect that the serial
    correlations are stronger for higher incidences, and weaker for lower
    incidences when the system depletion is recovered. To investigate how does
    $\rm GABA_B Rs$ influence the SW incidence, it is worth having a closer
    look at the possible involvement of the different $\rm GABA_B$ channels.

    It is been shown that a repetitive firing of certain interneurons can evoke
    slow and strong inhibition due to activation of postsynaptic or
    extrasynaptic $\rm GABA_B$ receptors on pyramids \citep{Scanziani2000,
    Gassmann2012}. As sharp waves are population events that recruit many
    neurons, and especially the perisomatic targeting interneurons
    \citep{Klausberg2009} it is likely that ambient GABA in this region is
    increased \citep{Hollnagel2014, Lang2014}. Next, I ask whether $\rm
    GABA_BRs$ located postsynaptically on pyramidal cells are indeed activated
    after SWs, and whether they play any role in the modulation of SWs. To test
    this hypothesis, here I analyse data from simultaneous (paired)
    extracellular and intracellular recordings performed in the radiatum layer
    of the hippocampal CA3 area and a pyramidal cell in the CA3, respectively.
    By averaging the intracellular traces across events, we can see that a GB
    hyperpolarization is present in a few recordings, but is not is not visible
    in the mean of all recordings (Figure~\ref{fig:intra_means}, top panel).
    Most intracellular traces show various combination of depolarization and
    hyperpolarization, indicating a rich dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory
    inputs. In the recordings that show a slow hyperpolarization (4 out of 13
    recordings, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:intra_means}, bottom panel) the trough
    in the membrane potential is around $200 \, \rm ms$ after the population
    event and lasts for about $500 \, \rm ms$. Interestingly, only one
    recording reveals well-pronounced slow as well as fast inhibition (red
    trace).

   \begin{figure}
      \includegraphics[width =30pc]{mean_intras.eps}
      \caption{ 
        Simultaneous extracellular and intracellular recordings in slices. {\bf
        top:} Intracellular recordings from patched pyramidal cells during
        sharp waves. The mean voltage traces associated to SWs from each slice
        are color coded; the thick black line is the mean of the means. {\bf
        bottom:} Mean voltage traces of cells that show slow, possibly $\rm
        GABA_BR$-evoked hyperpolarization. All traces are normalized by
        subtracting the mean potential the before the event.
              }
      \label{fig:intra_means}
    \end{figure}

    Is the slow hyperpolarization correlated in any way with the amplitude of
    the SWs? To test this, I separated the events in each recording in two
    groups: big and small events, i.e., the 30\% biggest or 30\%
    smallest events, respectively. Plotting the mean intracellular trace during
    small and big events, shows that the SWs with larger amplitudes are
    associated with larger hyperpolarization (Figure~\ref{fig:intra_big_small},
    top panel). Interestingly, the mean traces before big and small events are
    virtually indistinguishable (Figure~\ref{fig:intra_big_small}, bottom
    panel), suggesting that the hyperpolarization does not determine the size
    of the following event. This result holds for all the four recordings that
    exhibit slow inhibition in the voltage potential.
    
    \begin{figure}
      \includegraphics[width =30pc]{6dec11_cell4_000.eps}
      \caption{ 
        Sharp waves with larger peak amplitudes evoke stronger
        hyperpolarization. {\bf top:} Big events (30 \% of the largest SW
        events) are associated with a well-pronounced slow hyperpolarization.
        Smaller events (30\% of the smallest SWs) did not evoke a $\rm
        GABA_B$-associated response. The voltage difference preceding the
        events is a recording artifact (see the Methods section). {\bf bottom:}
        There is no correlation between the depolarisation of a cell and the
        peak amplitude of the following SW event.
              }
    \end{figure}

    Moreover, the slow hyperpolarization does not affect the time interval
    until the following event (not shown here). There is a correlation between
    the interval and the size of the following hyperpolarization, which is
    expected given the fact that longer intervals are followed by larger SWs,
    and thus, larger hyperpolarization.

    The last dataset of intracellular and extracellular recordings reveals that
    slow, possibly $\rm GABA_B$-associated hyperpolarization occurs only in a
    fraction of the CA3 pyramidal neurons {\textit{in vitro}}. The magnitude of
    the received inhibition is not correlated with the size or the time
    interval until the next event. Therefore, I conclude that postsynaptic $\rm
    GABA_B$ receptors do not play a central, if any, role in controlling the
    incidence of sharp-wave ripples.
 
    However, seems not to be crucial for SWRs, but only facilitates a bit?

    In summary, the gB antagonist SCH lead to increase in SW incidence in the in SW vitro model analysed here....?

    presynaptic effects of gB; likely not due to postsynaptic gBR on PY neurons (from simultaneous intra/extra recordings dataset); Maier2012? also suggests presynaptic effects of gB; however
      
    SCH decreases peak
      
    decreased peak means decreased currents; however, blocking presynaptic gBR would lead to increased single IPSC/P; therefore likely that SCH decreases FR of perisomatic targeting INs during SW events

\section{Discussion}

  summary:
    - low peak-interval correlation in comparison to interval-peak
    - SW amplitude is not a local phenomenon

  The exact effects of gabazine on the network activity invitro are not clear.
  It is still an open question how does gabazine change the activity of the PC and the different
  types of INs. 

  Stiedl2006: low concentration of gabazine (500 nM) in hippocmapal slices: only slight increase LFP in striatum rasiatum near pyramidal cell layer

  Schligloff2014 used local puffs of gabazine and showed that MUI activity during SWs in the stratum pyramidale is decreased. However does it also decrease outside of the events? A few more issues with this experiments is.. it was a local puff, and the identity of neurons is not known.

  Experiment suggestions: -

    - quantify network effects of gabazine:
      - measure and compare PC firing before and during gabazine administration
      - same for PVBC and the mysterious INs
    - identify the INs that inhibit PC firing between events.

    Behrens2007: gabazine hyperpolarized cells (in slices which were already induced), 
maybe because of ambient gaba??
  \subsection{Hypothesis on how gabazine affects SWR incidence} 

    %Local gabazine puff decreases the SW peaks in Schilinglof, but is also
    %decreases the MU firing \ref{fig:schlingloff_gabazine}. Cells are more
    %inhibited? However in another experiment the same authors measured PVBCs in
    %a loose patch and show that their FR is increased. This suggests some
  
    Why would gabazine increase the correlations??? especially for decreased
    incidence one would expect decreased correlations because of the longer
    time for synaptic recovery from STD...  The increase of SWR amplitudes
    measured in st. pyr. suggest larger synaptic currents in that region. On
    the other hand, gabazine decreases the synaptic currents from single
    presynaptic release. A plausible conclusion that can be made is that the
    smaller IPSC are compensated by larger firing of the PVBC. The larger PVBC
    firing leads to a stronger the synaptic depression and thus to a longer
    time of synaptic recovery. 

    --- make up a figure sketch of the idea: STP, PVBC FR --- here or in the discussion

   %disinhibitory mechanisms.... pc/PVBC ratio is 95/5 or 98/2...
    
    In summary, PC seems to be less excitable (due to lower FRs), while PVBCs
    fire more when gabazine is applied. Paradox: how does it happen that
    decreasing inhibition decreases SWR incidence, i.e., the network gets less
    excitable or more inhibited? Possible GBr receptor activation???? higher IN
    activity, leads to more gaba, more extrasynaptic activations...then

\section{Methods}
%________________
  The results in this chapter are bases on the analysis of data kindly provided
  by Nikolaus Maier from Schmitzlab. Here, I analyse 5 datasets of {\it in
  vitro} recordings. All the recordings were performed in the CA3 area of
  hippocampal slices. Here I give a brief summary about the datasets and
  provide some details on the techniques applied during the analysis.

  \subsection{Data}
  %________________
    \subsubsection{Dataset 1: gabazine}
     
      8? recordings.
      extracellular field potential, a few tens of minutes after the beginning of recording gabazine is infused in the extracellular solution.
      Sampling rates are between 5 and 10 kHz.
      Multiple sweeps of 30/60 seconds.
      In two recordings there was washout of the gabazine.
      gabazine 


      for further analysis time windows were chosen for the comparisons:
        -12 , -3 before and 6, 11 after the drug infusion.
        time to go home!




    \subsubsection{Dataset 2: SCH50,911}
      The second dataset contains extracellular recordings from 13 slices.
      Here, extracellular field potential is measured for several minutes
      depending on the recording, and later on the drug SCH50,911 was infused
      into the ?solution.  SCH50,911 is a ${\rm GABA_B}$ receptor antagonist
      which acts on presynaptic as well as on postsynaptic receptors.

    , but here I excluded one recording as it exhibits virtually
    no events prior to the drug application, and thus, heavily skews the average
    results.

    \subsubsection{Dataset 3: Extra and Intra}
      The third dataset consists of 13 pairs of recordings.  Each pair contains
      simultaneous extracellular field recording and intracellular recording
      from a patched pyramidal cell in a current clamp mode.  The recordings
      consist of multiple sweeps of around 5-20 seconds.  The length of each
      recording is rather short, ranging from 40 seconds up to 10 minutes.  The
      sampling rates are between 5 and 40 kHz.

  \subsection{Data analysis}

      To compare the SW sizes, I took the raw peaks of
      the events and normalize them such that for each electrode the mean peak
      is 0, and the std is 1.  becaure of diff location of th electrode..?
